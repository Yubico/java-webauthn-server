== Version 2.6.0 (unreleased) ==

New features:

* Added method `getParsedPublicKey(): java.security.PublicKey` to
  `RegistrationResult` and `RegisteredCredential`.
 ** Thanks to Jakob Heher (A-SIT) for the contribution, see
    https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/pull/299
* Added enum parsing functions:
 ** `AuthenticatorAttachment.fromValue(String): Optional<AuthenticatorAttachment>`
 ** `PublicKeyCredentialType.fromId(String): Optional<PublicKeyCredentialType>`
 ** `ResidentKeyRequirement.fromValue(String): Optional<ResidentKeyRequirement>`
 ** `TokenBindingStatus.fromValue(String): Optional<TokenBindingStatus>`
 ** `UserVerificationRequirement.fromValue(String): Optional<UserVerificationRequirement>`
* Added public builder to `CredentialPropertiesOutput`.
* Added public factory function
  `LargeBlobRegistrationOutput.supported(boolean)`.
* Added public factory functions to `LargeBlobAuthenticationOutput`.
* (Experimental) Added option `isSecurePaymentConfirmation(boolean)` to
  `FinishAssertionOptions`. When set, `RelyingParty.finishAssertion()` will
  adapt the validation logic for a Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) response
  instead of an ordinary WebAuthn response. See the JavaDoc for details.
 ** NOTE: Experimental features may receive breaking changes without a major
    version increase.
* (Experimental) Added a new suite of interfaces, starting with
  `CredentialRepositoryV2`. `RelyingParty` can now be configured with a
  `CredentialRepositoryV2` instance instead of a `CredentialRepository`
  instance. This changes the result of the `RelyingParty` builder to
  `RelyingPartyV2`. `CredentialRepositoryV2` and `RelyingPartyV2` enable a suite
  of new features:
 ** `CredentialRepositoryV2` does not assume that the application has usernames,
    instead username support is modular. In addition to the
    `CredentialRepositoryV2`, `RelyingPartyV2` can be optionally configured with
    a `UsernameRepository` as well. If a `UsernameRepository` is not set, then
    `RelyingPartyV2.startAssertion(StartAssertionOptions)` will fail at runtime
    if `StartAssertionOptions.username` is set.
 ** `CredentialRepositoryV2` uses a new interface `CredentialRecord` to
    represent registered credentials, instead of the concrete
    `RegisteredCredential` class (although `RegisteredCredential` also
    implements `CredentialRecord`). This provides implementations greater
    flexibility while also automating the type conversion to
    `PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor` needed in `startRegistration()` and
    `startAssertion()`.
 ** `RelyingPartyV2.finishAssertion()` returns a new type `AssertionResultV2`
    with a new method `getCredential()`, which returns the `CredentialRecord`
    that was verified. The return type of `getCredential()` is generic and
    preserves the concrete type of `CredentialRecord` returned by the
    `CredentialRepositoryV2` implementation.
 ** NOTE: Experimental features may receive breaking changes without a major
    version increase.
* (Experimental) Added property `RegisteredCredential.transports`.
 ** NOTE: Experimental features may receive breaking changes without a major
    version increase.
* (Experimental) Added property `credProps.authenticatorDisplayName`.
 ** NOTE: Experimental features may receive breaking changes without a major
    version increase.
* (Experimental) Added `credProps` extension to assertion extension outputs.


== Version 2.5.2 ==

Fixes:

* Allow unknown properties in `credProps` client extension output.


== Version 2.5.1 ==

Changes:

* Dropped dependency on COSE-Java.
* Fixed incompatibility with Jackson version 2.17.0-rc1.


== Version 2.5.0 ==

`webauthn-server-core`:

Breaking changes to experimental features:

* Added Jackson annotation `@JsonProperty` to method
  `RegisteredCredential.isBackedUp()`, changing the property name from
  `backedUp` to `backupState`. `backedUp` is still accepted during
  deserialization but will no longer be emitted during serialization.

New features:

* Added method `.isUserVerified()` to `RegistrationResult` and `AssertionResult`
  as a shortcut for accessing the UV flag in authenticator data.
* Updated README and JavaDoc to use the "passkey" term and provide more guidance
  around passkey use cases.
* Added `Automatic-Module-Name` to jar manifest.

Fixes:

* `AuthenticatorAttestationResponse` now tolerates and ignores properties
  `"publicKey"` and `"publicKeyAlgorithm"` during JSON deserialization. These
  properties are emitted by the `PublicKeyCredential.toJSON()` method added in
  WebAuthn Level 3.
* Relaxed Guava dependency version constraint to include major version 32.
* `RelyingParty.finishAssertion` now behaves the same if
  `StartAssertionOptions.allowCredentials` is explicitly set to a present, empty
  list as when absent.


`webauthn-server-attestation`:

New features:

* Added option `verifyDownloadsOnly(boolean)` to `FidoMetadataDownloader`. When
  set to `true`, the BLOB signature will not be verified when loading a BLOB
  from cache or when explicitly given. Default setting is `false`, which
  preserves the previous behaviour.
* Added `Automatic-Module-Name` to jar manifest.

Fixes:

* Made Jackson setting `PROPAGATE_TRANSIENT_MARKER` unnecessary for JSON
  serialization with Jackson version 2.15.0-rc1 and later.


== Version 2.4.1 ==

Changes:

* Added explicit version constraint on `jackson-bom`.

Fixes:

* Fixed incompatibility with Jackson version 2.15.0-rc1 and later.
* Fixed linking issue when running in Java 8.


== Version 2.4.0 ==

`webauthn-server-core`:

New features:

* Added support for RS384 and RS512 signature algorithms.
 ** Thanks to GitHub user JohnnyJayJay for the contribution, see
    https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/pull/235
* Added `userHandle` field to `AssertionRequest` as part of the second bug fix
  below. `userHandle` is mutually exclusive with `username`. This was originally
  released in pre-release `1.12.3-RC3`, but was accidentally left out of the
  `1.12.3` release.

Fixes:

* During `RelyingParty.finishRegistration()` if an `attestationTrustSource` is
  configured, if the `aaguid` in the authenticator data is zero, the call to
  `AttestationTrustSource.findTrustRoots` will fall back to reading the AAGUID
  from the attestation certificate if possible.
* Fixed bug in `RelyingParty.finishAssertion` where if
  `StartAssertionOptions.userHandle` was set, it did not propagate to
  `RelyingParty.finishAssertion` and caused an error saying username and user
  handle are both absent unless a user handle was returned by the authenticator.
  This was originally released in pre-release `1.12.3-RC3`, but was accidentally
  left out of the `1.12.3` release.
* Fixed regression in
  `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions.toCredentialsCreateJson()`, which has not
  been emitting a `requireResidentKey` member since version `2.0.0`. This meant
  the JSON output was not backwards compatible with browsers that only support
  the Level 1 version of the WebAuthn spec.


`webauthn-server-attestation`:

Fixes:

* `findEntries` and `findTrustRoots` methods in `FidoMetadataService` now
  attempt to read AAGUID from the attestation certificate if the `aaguid`
  argument is absent or zero.
* Method `FidoMetadataService.Filters.allOf` now has `@SafeVarargs` annotation.


== Version 2.3.0 ==

New features:

* (Experimental) Added `authenticatorAttachment` property to response objects:
 ** NOTE: Experimental features may receive breaking changes without a major
    version increase.
 ** Added method `getAuthenticatorAttachment()` to `PublicKeyCredential` and
    corresponding builder method
    `authenticatorAttachment(AuthenticatorAttachment)`.
 ** Added method `getAuthenticatorAttachment()` to `RegistrationResult` and
    `AssertionResult`, which echo `getAuthenticatorAttachment()` from the
    corresponding `PublicKeyCredential`.
 ** Thanks to GitHub user luisgoncalves for the contribution, see
    https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/pull/250

Other:

* Fixed the README description of SemVer exceptions: `@Deprecated` features are
  still part of the public API unless they also have an `EXPERIMENTAL:` tag in
  JavaDoc.
* Brought `com.yubico.webauthn` package JavaDoc up to date with new library
  features.


== Version 2.2.0 ==

`webauthn-server-core`:

Changes:

* Changed internal structure of `RegistrationResult` and `AssertionResult`. This
  may affect you if you use Jackson or similar tools to serialize these values
  to JSON, for example. This is not an officially supported use case and thus
  does not warrant a major version bump.
* Removed methods `RegistrationResult.toBuilder()` and
  `AssertionResult.toBuilder()`. Both had package-private return types, and thus
  were not usable by outside callers.

New features:

* (Experimental) Added support for the new `BE` (backup eligible) and `BS`
  (backup state) flags in authenticator data:
 ** NOTE: Experimental features may receive breaking changes without a major
    version increase.
 ** Added `BE` and `BS` properties to `AuthenticatorDataFlags`, reflecting the
    respective flags (bits 0x08 and 0x10).
 ** Added methods `isBackupEligible()` and `isBackedUp()` to
    `RegistrationResult` and `AssertionResult`, reflecting respectively the `BE`
    and `BS` flags.
 ** Added properties `backupEligible` and `backupState`, getters
    `isBackupEligible()` and `isBackedUp()`, and corresponding builder methods
    to `RegisteredCredential`. `RelyingParty.finishAssertion(...)` will now
    validate that if `RegisteredCredential.isBackupEligible()` is present, then
    the `BE` flag of any assertion of that credential must match the stored
    value.

Fixes:

* Fixed TPM attestation verification rejecting attestation certificates with TPM
  Device Attributes split between multiple RelativeDistinguishedName structures
  in the Subject Alternative Names extension.
 ** Thanks to Oussama Zgheb for the contribution, see
    https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/pull/241
* Fixed various errors in JavaDoc.


`webauthn-server-attestation`:

Fixes:

* Improved documentation of guarantees provided by `FidoMetadataDownloader` and
  required of its parameters.


== Version 2.1.0 ==

`webauthn-server-core`:

Changes:

* Log messages on attestation certificate path validation failure now include
  the attestation object.

Deprecations:

* Deprecated method `AssertionResult.getCredentialId(): ByteArray`. Use
  `.getCredential().getCredentialId()` instead.
* Deprecated method `AssertionResult.getUserHandle(): ByteArray`. Use
  `.getCredential().getUserHandle()` instead.

New features:

* Added function `COSEAlgorithmIdentifier.fromPublicKey(ByteArray)`.
* Added method `AssertionResult.getCredential(): RegisteredCredential`.
* Added support for the `"tpm"` attestation statement format.
* Added support for ES384 and ES512 signature algorithms.
* Added property `policyTreeValidator` to `TrustRootsResult`. If set, the given
  predicate function will be used to validate the certificate policy tree after
  successful attestation certificate path validation. This may be required for
  some JCA providers to accept attestation certificates with critical
  certificate policy extensions. See the JavaDoc for
  `TrustRootsResultBuilder.policyTreeValidator(Predicate)` for more information.
* Added enum value `AttestationConveyancePreference.ENTERPRISE`.
* (Experimental) Added constant `AuthenticatorTransport.HYBRID`.

Fixes:

* Fixed various typos and mistakes in JavaDocs.
* Moved version constraints for test dependencies from meta-module
  `webauthn-server-parent` to unpublished test meta-module.
* `yubico-util` dependency removed from downstream compile scope.
* Fixed missing JavaDoc on `TrustRootsResult` getters and builder setters.


`webauthn-server-attestation`:

Changes:

* The `AuthenticatorToBeFiltered` argument of the `FidoMetadataService` runtime
  filter now omits zero AAGUIDs.
* Promoted log messages in `FidoMetadataDownloader` about BLOB signature failure
  and cache corruption from DEBUG level to WARN level.

New features:

* Added method `FidoMetadataDownloader.refreshBlob()`.

Fixes:

* Fixed various typos and mistakes in JavaDocs.
* `FidoMetadataDownloader` now verifies the SHA-256 hash of the cached trust
  root certificate, as promised in the JavaDoc of `useTrustRootCacheFile` and
  `useTrustRootCache`.
* BouncyCastle dependency dropped.
* Guava dependency dropped (but still remains in core module).
* If BLOB download fails, `FidoMetadataDownloader` now correctly falls back to
  cache if available.


== Version 2.0.0 ==

This release removes deprecated APIs and changes some defaults to better align
with the L2 version of the WebAuthn spec. It also adds a new major feature:
optional integration with the FIDO Metadata Service for retrieving authenticator
metadata and attestation trust roots. See below for details.

`webauthn-server-core`:

Breaking changes:

* Deleted deprecated `icon` field in `RelyingPartyIdentity` and `UserIdentity`,
  and its associated methods.
* Deleted deprecated `AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria` methods
  `builder().requireResidentKey(boolean)` and `isRequireResidentKey()`.
* `RelyingParty` parameter `allowUnrequestedExtensions` removed. The library
  will now always accept unrequested extensions.
* Class `ClientAssertionExtensionOutputs` now silently ignores unknown
  extensions instead of rejecting them.
* `webauthn-server-core-minimal` module deleted.
* `webauthn-server-core` no longer depends on BouncyCastle and will no longer
  attempt to automatically fall back to it. Therefore, EdDSA keys are no longer
  supported by default in JDK 14 and earlier. The library will log warnings if
  configured for algorithms with no JCA provider available, in which case the
  dependent project may need to add additional dependencies and configure JCA
  providers externally.
* Enum value `AttestationType.ECDAA` removed without replacement.
* Deleted methods `RegistrationResult.getWarnings()` and
  `AssertionResult.getWarnings()` since they are now always empty.
* Framework for attestation metadata has been fully overhauled. See the
  `webauthn-server-attestation` module documentation for the new ways to work
  with attestation metadata:
 ** Deleted method `RegistrationResult.getAttestationMetadata()`.
 ** Interface `MetadataService` replaced with `AttestationTrustSource`, and
    optional `RelyingParty` setting `.metadataService(MetadataService)` replaced
    with `.attestationTrustSource(AttestationTrustSource)`.
 ** Deleted types `Attestation` and `Transport`.
 ** Deleted method `AuthenticatorTransport.fromU2fTransport`.
* `RelyingParty.finishRegistration()` now uses a JCA `CertPathValidator` to
  validate attestation certificate paths, if an attestation trust source has
  been configured. This requires a compatible JCA provider, but should already
  be available in most environments.
* Classes in package `com.yubico.fido.metadata` moved to
  `com.yubico.webauthn.extension.uvm` to avoid name clash with
  `webauthn-server-attestation` module in JPMS.
* Changed return type of
  `PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions.getUserVerification()`,
  `AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria.getUserVerification()` and
  `AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria.getResidentKey()` to `Optional`, and changed
  defaults for `userVerification` and `residentKey` to empty. This means we
  won't inadvertently suppress warnings that browsers might issue in the browser
  console if for example `userVerification` is not set explicitly.

New features:

* Method `getAaguid()` added to `RegistrationResult`.
* Method `getAttestationTrustPath()` added to `RegistrationResult`.
* Setting `.clock(Clock)` added to `RelyingParty`. It is used for attestation
  path validation if an `attestationTrustSource` is configured.


`webauthn-server-attestation`:

Breaking changes:

* Types `AttestationResolver`, `CompositeAttestationResolver`,
  `CompositeTrustResolver`, `DeviceMatcher`, `ExtensionMatcher`,
  `FingerprintMatcher`, `MetadataObject`, `SimpleAttestationResolver`,
  `SimpleTrustResolver`, `StandardMetadataService` and `TrustResolver` deleted
  in favour of a new attestation metadata framework. Some of the functionality
  is retained as the new `YubicoJsonMetadataService` class in the
  `webauthn-server-demo` subproject in the library sources, but no longer
  exposed in either library module.
* Library no longer contains a `/metadata.json` resource.

New features:

* New types `FidoMetadataService` and `FidoMetadataDownloader` which integrate
  with the FIDO Metadata Service for retrieving authenticator metadata and
  attestation trust roots.


== Version 1.12.4 ==

Deprecated features:

* Option `RelyingParty.allowUnrequestedExtensions` deprecated. The `false`
  setting (default) is not compatible with WebAuthn Level 2 since authenticators
  are now always allowed to add unsolicited extensions. The next major version
  release will remove this option and always behave as if the option had been
  set to `true`.
* Enum value `AttestationType.ECDAA`. ECDAA was removed in WebAuthn Level 2.
* Function `TokenBindingStatus.fromJsonString(String)` deprecated. It should not
  have been part of the public API to begin with.


== Version 1.12.3 ==

Fixes:

* Fixed `PublicKeyCredential` failing to parse from JSON if an
  `"authenticatorAttachment"` attribute was present.
* Bumped Jackson dependency to version [2.13.2.1,3) in response to
  CVE-2020-36518
* Fixed bug in `RelyingParty.finishAssertion` that would throw a nondescript
  `NoSuchElementException` if username and user handle are both absent, instead
  of an `IllegalArgumentException` with a better error message.


== Version 1.12.2 ==

Fixes:

* `com.upokecenter:cbor` dependency bumped to minimum version 4.5.1 due to a
  known vulnerability, see: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fj2w-wfgv-mwq6
* Fixed crash in `AuthenticatorData` deserialization with `com.upokecenter:cbor`
  versions later than 4.0.1


== Version 1.12.1 ==

Fixes:

* `RelyingParty.finishAssertion()` no longer makes multiple (redundant) calls to
  `CredentialRepository.lookup()`.


== Version 1.12.0 ==

New features:

* New method `RegisteredCredential.builder().publicKeyEs256Raw(ByteArray)`. This
  is a mutually exclusive alternative to `.publicKeyCose(ByteArray)`, for easier
  backwards-compatibility with U2F-formatted (Raw ANSI X9.62) public keys.
* "Migrating from U2F" section added to project README


== Version 1.11.0 ==

Deprecated features:

* `AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria` methods
  `builder().requireResidentKey(boolean)` and `isRequireResidentKey()`
  deprecated in favor of a new option, see below.
* The `icon` field in `RelyingPartyIdentity` and `UserIdentity`, and its
  associated methods, are now deprecated. The corresponding property was removed
  in WebAuthn Level 2.

Deprecated features will be removed in the next major version release.

Changes:

* `RelyingParty.startAssertion()` no longer overwrites the `appid` extension
  input in the `StartAssertionOptions` argument.
* `RelyingParty.appId` setting now also activates the `appidExclude` extension in
  addition to the `appid` extension.
* `RelyingParty.startRegistration()` now enables the `credProps` extension by
  default. The extension output, if any, is available as
  `RegistrationResult.isDiscoverable()` and
  `RegistrationResult.getClientExtensionOutputs().getCredProps()`.

New features:

* `RegistrationResult.keyId()` now includes `transports` if any were included in
  the `AuthenticatorAttestatationResponse`. To get transports passed through,
  call `PublicKeyCredential.response.getTransports()` on the client side after
  successful registration, and add the result as the property
  `response.transports` in the JSON passed into
  `PublicKeyCredential.parseRegistrationResponseJson`. See the project README
  for an example.
* Added support for the `appidExclude`, `credProps`, `largeBlob` and `uvm`
  extensions.
* Added support for the new `authenticatorSelectionCriteria.residentKey` option:
 ** Added method
    `AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria.builder().residentKey(ResidentKeyRequirement)`.
 ** Added method `AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria.getResidentKey()`.
 ** Methods `builder().requireResidentKey(boolean)` and `isRequireResidentKey()`
    deprecated in favor of the above two new methods.
 ** The builder methods `requireResidentKey(boolean)` and
    `residentKey(ResidentKeyRequirement)` both control one shared setting, which
    sets both the `requireResidentKey` and `residentKey` options simultaneously
    and in agreement with each other for backwards compatibility with older
    browsers.
* Added methods `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions.toCredentialsCreateJson()`,
  `PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions.toCredentialsGetJson()` and
  `AssertionRequest.toCredentialsGetJson()` for serializing to JSON without
  having to use Jackson directly.
* Added methods `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions.toJson()` and
  `.fromJson(String)` suitable for encoding to and decoding from JSON.
* Added methods `AssertionRequest.toJson()` and `.fromJson(String)` suitable for
  encoding to and decoding from JSON.
* Added methods `StartAssertionOptions.builder().userHandle(ByteArray)` and
  `.userHandle(Optional<ByteArray>)` as alternatives to `.username(String)` and
  `.username(Optional<String>)`. The `userHandle` methods fill the same function
  as, and are mutually exclusive with, the `username` methods.

Fixes:

* Added missing JavaDoc for `id` and `name` methods of initial
  `RelyingPartyIdentityBuilder` stages.
* Added and improved JavaDoc for required builder methods.
* Javadoc for `TokenBindingInfo.id` incorrectly stated that the value is
  base64url encoded.
* Javadoc for `TokenBindingStatus.PRESENT` incorrectly referenced its own
  (private) `id` member instead of `TokenBindingInfo.id`.
* Improved JavaDoc for `StartRegistrationOptions.authenticatorSelection`
* Improved JavaDoc for `RelyingParty.appid`
* Make the `RelyingParty.validateSignatureCounter` JavaDoc also cover the
  success case where stored and received signature count are both zero.


== Version 1.10.1 ==

webauthn-server-attestation:

* Fixed name of YubiKey Bio - FIDO edition in attestation metadata.


== Version 1.10.0 ==

webauthn-server-attestation:

* Added attestation metadata for YubiKey Bio.


== Version 1.9.1 ==

* Added missing `<dependencyManagement>` declaration to
  `webauthn-server-attestation` and `webauthn-server-core` POMs.

webauthn-server-attestation:

* Added attestation metadata for YubiKey 5 FIPS series.


== Version 1.9.0 ==

webauthn-server-attestation:

* Fixed that `SimpleAttestationResolver` would return empty transports when
  transports are unknown.

webauthn-server-core:

* Added support for the `"apple"` attestation statement format.

Other:

* Dependency versions moved to new meta-module `webauthn-server-parent`. Users
  should never need to depend on `webauthn-server-parent` directly.


== Version 1.8.0 ==

Changes:

* BouncyCastle dependency is now optional.

  In order to opt out, depend on `webauthn-server-core-minimal` instead of
  `webauthn-server-core`.
  This is not recommended unless you know your JVM includes JCA providers for
  all signature algorithms.

  Note that `webauthn-server-attestation` still depends on BouncyCastle.

* Jackson deserializer for `PublicKeyCredential` now allows a `rawId` property
  to be present if `id` is not present, or if `rawId` equals `id`.


== Version 1.7.0 ==

webauthn-server-attestation:

* Updated name of AAGUID `2fc0579f811347eab116bb5a8db9202a` to "YubiKey 5/5C NFC"
* Changed name of "YubiKey 5 Series security key" to "YubiKey 5 Series"

webauthn-server-core:

Changes:

* Fixed crash on unknown attestation statement formats
 ** Unless `RelyingParty.allowUntrustedAttestation` is set to `false`, unknown
    attestation statements will now pass as untrusted attestations, instead of
    throwing an IllegalArgumentException.
* Disambiguated Jackson deserialization of class `AuthenticatorTransport`

New features:

* Class `RegisteredCredential` can now be serialized to and deserialized from
  JSON.


== Version 1.6.4 ==

* Changed dependency declarations to version ranges
* Bumped Guava dependency to version [24.1.1,30) in response to CVE-2018-10237


== Version 1.6.3 ==

webauthn-server-attestation:

* Added new YubiKey AAGUIDs to metadata.json


webauthn-server-core:

* Bumped Jackson dependency to version 2.11.0 in response to CVEs:
 ** CVE-2020-9546
 ** CVE-2020-10672
 ** CVE-2020-10969
 ** CVE-2020-11620
* Fixed incorrect JavaDoc on AssertionResult.isSignatureCounterValid(): it will
  also return true if both counters are zero.


== Version 1.6.2 ==

* Fixed dependencies missing from release POM metadata


== Version 1.6.1 ==

Security fixes:

* Bumped Jackson dependency to version 2.9.10.3 in response to CVE-2019-20330
  and CVE-2020-8840


== Version 1.6.0 ==

Security fixes:

* Bumped Jackson dependency to version 2.9.10.1 which has patched CVE-2019-16942

`webauthn-server-core`:

Bug fixes:

* Fixed bug introduced in 1.4.0, which caused
  `RegistrationResult.attestationMetadata` to always be empty.


`webauthn-server-attestation`:

* New enum constant `Transport.LIGHTNING`
* Fixed transports field of YubiKey NEO/NEO-n in `metadata.json`.
* Added YubiKey 5Ci to `metadata.json`.
* Most `deviceUrl` fields in `metadata.json` changed to point to stable
  addresses in Yubico knowledge base instead of dead redirects in store.


== Version 1.5.0 ==

Changes:

* `RelyingParty` now makes an immutable copy of the `origins` argument, instead
  of storing a reference to a possibly mutable value.
* The enum `AuthenticatorTransport` has been replaced by a value class
  containing methods and value constants equivalent to the previous enum.
* The return type of `PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor.getTransports()` is now a
  `SortedSet` instead of `Set`. The builder still accepts a plain `Set`.
* Registration ceremony now verifies that the returned credential public key
  matches one of the algorithms specified in
  `RelyingParty.preferredPubkeyParams` and can be successfully parsed.

New features:

* Origin matching can now be relaxed via two new `RelyingParty` options:
  * `allowOriginPort` (default `false`): Allow any port number in the origin
  * `allowOriginSubdomain` (default `false`): Allow any subdomain of any origin
    listed in `RelyingParty.origins`
  * See JavaDoc for details and examples.
* The new `AuthenticatorTransport` can now contain any string value as the
  transport identifier, as required in the editor's draft of the L2 spec. See:
  https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/pull/1275
* Added support for RS1 credentials. Registration of RS1 credentials is not
  enabled by default, but can be enabled by setting
  `RelyingParty.preferredPubKeyCredParams` to a list containing
  `PublicKeyCredentialParameters.RS1`.
  * New constant `PublicKeyCredentialParameters.RS1`
  * New constant `COSEAlgorithmIdentifier.RS1`


== Version 1.4.1 ==

Packaging fixes:

* Fixed dependency declarations so API dependencies are correctly propagated as
  compile-time dependencies of dependent projects.
* Fixed Specification-Version release date in webauthn-server-core jar manifest.


== Version 1.4.0 ==

Changes:

* Class `com.yubico.internal.util.WebAuthnCodecs` is no longer public. The
  package `com.yubico.internal.util` was already declared non-public in JavaDoc,
  but this is now also enforced via Java visibility rules.
* Class `com.yubico.webauthn.meta.Specification.SpecificationBuilder` is no
  longer public. It was never intended to be, although this was not documented
  explicitly.
* Default value for `RelyingParty.preferredPubKeyParams` changed from `[ES256,
  RS256]` to `[ES256, EdDSA, RS256]`
* Data classes no longer use `Optional` internally in field types. This should
  not meaningfully affect the public API, but might improve compatibility with
  frameworks that use reflection.

New features:

* Added support for Ed25519 signatures.
* New constants `COSEAlgorithmIdentifier.EdDSA` and
  `PublicKeyCredentialParameters.EdDSA`
* Artifacts are now built reproducibly; fresh builds from source should now be
  verifiable by signature files from Maven Central.

Security fixes:

* Bumped Jackson dependency to version 2.9.9.3 which has patched CVE-2019-12814,
  CVE-2019-14439, CVE-2019-14379


== Version 1.3.0 ==

Security fixes:

* Bumped Jackson dependency to version 2.9.9 which has patched CVE-2019-12086

New features:

* New optional parameter `timeout` added to `StartRegistrationOptions` and
  `StartAssertionOptions`

Bug fixes:

* Fixed polarity error in javadoc for `RelyingParty.allowUntrustedAttestation`


== Version 1.2.0 ==

New features:

* RSA keys are now supported.
* New constructor functions `PublicKeyCredential.parseRegistrationResponseJson` and `.parseAssertionResponseJson`
  * So users don't have to deal with the `TypeReference`s imposed by the generics, unless they want to.

Bug fixes:

* `android-key` attestation statements now don't throw an exception if
  `allowUntrustedAttestation` is set to `true`.
* `tpm` attestation statements now don't throw an exception if
  `allowUntrustedAttestation` is set to `true`.


== Version 1.1.0 ==

Changed behaviours:

* `AssertionExtensionInputsBuilder.appid(Optional<AppId>)` now fails fast if the
  argument is `null`
* `ClientAssertionExtensionOutputsBuilder.appid(Optional<Boolean>)` now fails
  fast if the argument is `null`


New features:

* Public API methods that take `Optional` parameters now come with
  `Optional`-less aliases.


== Version 1.0.1 ==

Bugfixes:

* Registration no longer fails for unimplemented attestation statement formats
  if `allowUnknownAttestation` is set to `true`.
 ** Registration still fails for attestation statement formats not defined in
    the WebAuthn Level 1 spec.


== Version 1.0.0 ==

* Fixed URL in artifact POM
* Improved a few javadoc wordings


== Version 0.8.0 ==

Possibly breaking changes:

* User Presence (UP) is now always required by the spec, not only when UV is not
  required; implementation updated to reflect this.


New features:

* Added support for `android-safetynet` attestation statement format
 ** Thanks to Ren Lin for the contribution, see https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/pull/5
* Implementation updated to reflect Proposed Recommendation version of the spec,
  released 2019-01-17

Bug fixes:

* Fixed validation of zero-valued assertion signature counter
 ** Previously, a zero-valued assertion signature counter was always regarded as
    valid. Now, it is only considered valid if the stored signature counter is
    also zero.


== Version 0.7.0 ==

=== `webauthn-server-attestation` ===

* Added attestation metadata for Security Key NFC by Yubico

=== `webauthn-server-core` ===

Breaking changes:

* Deleted parameter `RelyingParty.verifyTypeAttribute`. This was added as a
  workaround while browser implementations were incomplete, and should never be
  used in production.
* Replaced field `RegisteredCredential.publicKey: PublicKey` with
  `publicKeyCose: ByteArray`. This means the library user no longer needs to
  parse the public key before passing it back into the library.
* `RelyingParty.finishAssertion` now throws `InvalidSignatureCountException`
  instead of its supertype `AssertionFailedException` when signature count
  validation is enabled and the received signature count is invalid.

New features:

* New parameter `StartAssertionOptions.userVerification` which is forwarded into
  `PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions` by `RelyingParty.startAssertion`


== Version 0.6.0 ==

Breaking changes:

* Classes moved from package `com.yubico.webauthn.data` to `com.yubico.webauthn`:
 **  `AssertionRequest`
 **  `AssertionResult`
 **  `RegistrationResult`
* All public classes are now final.
* All builders now enforce mandatory arguments at compile time. Some usages may
  therefore need to adjust the order of calls on the builder instance.
 ** Static method `Attestation.trusted(boolean)` replaced with `.builder()` with
    `.trusted(boolean)` as builder method instead
 ** `AuthenticatorAssertionResponse` constructor is now private.
 ** `AuthenticatorAttestationResponse` constructor is now private.
 ** `PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor` constructor is now private.
 ** `PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions` constructor is now private.
* All classes that take collections as constructor (builder) arguments now make
  shallow copies of those collections, so that mutations of the collections
  don't propagate into the class instance.
* Deleted interface `Crypto` and constructor parameter `crypto` of `RelyingParty`
* Deleted interface `ChallengeGenerator` and constructor parameter
  `challengeGenerator` of `RelyingParty`
* Updated implementation to agree with current editor's draft of the spec
 ** Renamed class `AttestationData` to `AttestedCredentialData`
 ** Enum constant `TokenBindingStatus.NOT_SUPPORTED` deleted; this is now
    instead signaled by a missing value
 ** Parameter `RelyingParty.allowMissingTokenBinding` therefore removed
 ** Enum constant `AttestationType.PRIVACY_CA` renamed to `ATTESTATION_CA`
* Renamed class `AuthenticationDataFlags` to `AuthenticatorDataFlags`
* Deleted constant `UserVerificationRequirement.DEFAULT`
* Deleted method `AttestationObject.getAuthData()`
* Changed type of field `RelyingParty.origins` from `List` to `Set`
* Fixed (reduced) visibility of `RegisteredCredential` fields
* Class `MetadataObject` moved to `webauthn-server-attestation` module
* Updated and greatly expanded Javadoc

New features:

* Constructor parameter `pubKeyCredParams` of `RelyingParty` is now optional
  with a default value.
* Constructor parameter `origins` of `RelyingParty` is now optional and defaults
  to a list whose only element is the RP ID prefixed with `https://`.
* All classes with a builder now also have a `.toBuilder()` method.


== Version 0.5.0 ==

=== `webauthn-server-core` ===

New features:

* `PackedAttestationStatementVerifier` now supports SHA256WithRSA signatures

Bug fixes:

* `PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor.compareTo` is now consistent with equals
* `AuthenticatorData` constructor should now throw more descriptive exceptions
  instead of raw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`s


=== `webauthn-server-attestation` ===

Breaking changes:

* Interface `MetadataResolver` replaced with interfaces `AttestationResolver`
  and `TrustResolver`
 ** Class `SimpleResolver` split into `SimpleAttestationResolver` and
    `SimpleTrustResolver`
  *** Both of these classes now take the metadata as a constructor parameter
      instead of exposing `addMetadata` methods
 ** Class `CompositeResolver` split into `CompositeAttestationResolver` and
    `CompositeTrustResolver`
* Class `StandardMetadataService` overhauled


== Version 0.4.0 ==

Breaking changes:

* Field `StartRegistrationOptions.requireResidentKey: boolean` replaced with
  field `authenticatorSelection: Optional<AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria>`


== Version 0.3.0 ==

* Major API overhaul; public API changes include but are not limited to:
 ** Reorganised package structure
 ** `CredentialRepository.getCredentialIdsForUsername(String)` now returns `Set`
    instead of `List`
 ** Most data classes now expose a builder instead of a public constructor
 ** Shortcut constants added to `COSEAlgorithmIdentifier` and
    `PublicKeyCredentialParameters`
 ** Exception `U2fBadConfigurationException` renamed to
    `BadConfigurationException`
 ** `RelyingParty.startRegistration` now accepts one `StartRegistrationOptions`
    parameter instead of several parameters
 ** `RelyingParty.finishRegistration` now accepts one
    `FinishRegistrationOptions` parameter instead of several parameters
 ** `RelyingParty.startAssertion` now accepts one `StartAssertionOptions`
    parameter instead of several parameters
 ** `RelyingParty.finishAssertion` now accepts one `FinishAssertionOptions`
    parameter instead of several parameters
 ** `RelyingParty.finishRegistration` now throws checked
    `RegistrationFailedException` instead of `IllegalArgumentException` on most
    failures
 ** `RelyingParty.finishAssertion` now throws checked
    `AssertionFailedException` instead of `IllegalArgumentException` on most
    failures
 ** Class `MetadataResolver` replaced with interface
 ** Constructor `CollectedClientData(JsonNode)` deleted
 ** Parameters `StartRegistrationOptions.excludeCredentials` and
    `StartAssertionOptions.allowCredentials` deleted; they are now discovered
    automatically from the `CredentialRepository`. If custom control over
    `excludeCredentials` or `allowCredentials` is needed, modify the
    `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` or `PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions`
    object manually.
 ** `COSEAlgorithmIdentifier` is now an actual enum
 ** Extensions are now passed and returned as domain objects instead of as Jackson
    types
 ** Type parameter added to `PublicKeyCredential` to express extensions type
 ** Fields `CollectedClientData.authenticatorExtensions` and `.clientExtensions`
    deleted
* Fixed a bug in `AuthenticatorDataFlags` that caused the `ED` (0x80) flag to
  never be set
* All classes in `com.yubico.webauthn.data` can now be serialized and
  deserialized using Jackson
 ** JSON output has been slightly changed:
  *** `AttestationObject`, `AuthenticatorData` and `CollectedClientData` now serialize back to
    Base64Url encoded bytes instead of to JSON objects
  *** Member `_attestationObject` removed from serialized
      `AuthenticatorAttestationResponse`
  *** Member `authenticatorData` removed from serialized
      `AuthenticatorAttestationResponse`
* New methods `ByteArray.size(): int` and `.isEmpty(): boolean`
* `ByteArray` is now `Comparable` to itself
* Added support for `appid` extension


== Version 0.2.0 ==

* Core library now recognises username as an internally relevant concept
* Source code translated from Scala to Java
* Too many other changes to count


== Version 0.1.0 ==

* First release of https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[Web Authentication] support

== java-u2flib-server version history ==

This project was forked from https://developers.yubico.com/java-u2flib-server/[java-u2flib-server]. Below is the version history from before the fork.


== Version 0.19.0 ==

Breaking changes:

* Overhauled exception hierarchy
 ** New exception class: `U2fCeremonyException`
 ** New exception class: `U2fRegistrationException extends U2fCeremonyException`
 ** New exception class: `U2fAuthenticationException extends U2fCeremonyException`
 ** The following exception classes now extend `U2fAuthenticationException`:
  *** `DeviceCompromisedException`
  *** `InvalidDeviceCounterException`
  *** `NoEligableDevicesException`
  *** `NoEligibleDevicesException`
 ** `U2fBadConfigurationException` is now a checked exception
 ** `U2fBadInputException` is now a checked exception, and is no longer thrown directly by the methods of `U2F`.
  *** Methods of `U2F` now catch this exception and wrap it in a `U2fRegistrationException` or ``U2fAuthenticationException`.
* `DeviceRegistration.getAttestationCertificate()` now returns `null` instead of throwing `NoSuchFieldException`
* `static ClientData.getString(JsonNode, String)` now throws `U2fBadInputException` instead of `NullPointerException`, or if the returned field is not a `String` value
