_Note: This is a work in progress. The https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[Web
Authentication standard] is not yet finished, and additional pre-1.0 releases of
this library may introduce breaking API changes._

Server-side https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[Web Authentication] library for
Java. Provides implementations of the
https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#rp-operations[Relying Party operations] required
for a server to support Web Authentication. This includes registering
authenticators and authenticating registered authenticators.


=== Planned breaking changes

None.


=== Example Usage

See link:webauthn-server-demo[`webauthn-server-demo`] for a complete demo
server, which stores authenticator registrations temporarily in memory.


=== Building

Use the included
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle wrapper] to
build the `.jar` artifact:

----------
$ ./gradlew :webauthn-server-core:jar
----------

The output is built in the `webauthn-server-core/build/libs/` directory, and the
version is derived from the most recent Git tag. Builds done on a tagged commit
will have a plain `x.y.z` version number, while a build on any other commit will
result in a version number containing the abbreviated commit hash.

Although the `.jar` artifact of this project can be used in JDK version 8 or
later, the project as a whole currently builds only in JDK 8. This is because
most tests are written in Scala, which
https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/jdk-compatibility/overview.html#jdk-9\--up-compatibility-notes[currently
only supports JDK 8]. Therefore compiling the tests can currently only be done
in JDK 8, and so `./gradlew build` and similar tasks will fail in JDKs other
than 8.

To run the tests (requires JDK 8):

----------
$ ./gradlew check
----------

To run the http://pitest.org/[PIT mutation tests] (requires JDK 8):

----------
$ ./gradlew pitest
----------
